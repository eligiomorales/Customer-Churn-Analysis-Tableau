### Customer Churn Analysis with Tableau

This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau. As part of the Career Track "Data Analyst in Tableau" available on DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-analyst-in-tableau)

## The data
Databel consists of 29 columns and has one row per customer. The analysis is based on a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time, so there is no time dimension.
